- 👋 Hi, I'm Rhonders a.k.a Rhonda A. Espinosa ✨

- 👀 I’m interested in PTSD assistance for the USMC, active and/or non-active.(or within the US Naval Dept itself, if possible.)

 
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to find a way to implement or discuss this concept into possible action i.e; literature and it's various formats. 


- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a more comprehensive and complete way to provide useful PTSD assistance to the USMC, especially after deployments no matter when they occured.


  ✨ How to reach me; please contact me through this link or my USPS address of 34055 Mallard Ave, Nehalem Oregon 97131.
